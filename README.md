# 🧠 CodeSignal Solutions

Welcome to the **CodeSignal Solutions** repository! This repo contains some of my proposed solutions to a wide range of **CodeSignal coding problems**, solved using **JavaScript** and **Go**.

## 🚀 Purpose

This repository is designed to:
- Practice and master **data structures** and **algorithms**
- Prepare for **technical interviews**
- Serve as a reference for solving common coding problems

## 🛠️ Languages Used

- 🟨 **JavaScript (JS)** – great for frontend developers and fast prototyping
- 🟦 **Go (Golang)** – powerful for backend development and high-performance computing
